      <h3>BEFORE</h3>
      <p>Cut day! Sketchup was great for figuring out materials and cutting these 2x4s quickly. In retrospect, I'm still glad I saved money on these, but I wish I had milled them square first.</p>

      <h3>DURING</h3>
      <p>Added tarps because the roommate was mad about dust getting on his stuff. Also for this taking way longer than anticipated. This is 2 weeks into the second phase, 8+ hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
